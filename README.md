Take a pen and a book then write down the stages...and use it as a guide when you finish stage one tick it on your book.


## Stages:

### Initiation:
Here you will do brain storming you will ask yourself the following questions.
* 1. What am I good at? (Mention at least five things..include your profession or school work)
Am good in the following areas
1.Data  Collection entry
2.Teaching
3.Ict
4.Mentorship
* 2. What projects can I do with my strengths? (Try and align projects with your answer from question 1.)
I can do  education related project, This is after realising that we have the same idea with some of my fellow student i there for decided we collaborate in doing a learning management system that will aid the teaching and learning in the schools as instutions.
* 3. You can also ask what challenge am i facing at school and also at home or my village or church. (Write any that comes to mind)
As Aparent for school going children am being faced with alot of challenges as my kids can't access education materials oonline,Alot 
work is done through paper work,It is also very difficult to retrieve student information
* 4. Among the challenges what solution can I have? ( Create it as a project idea.)
comming up with Learning Management system can be a greater solution as this  will help the learners
,teachers and even the parents 
* 5. Ask yourself what your goals are.
I would like to see learners have the privilege  of accessing information and also to effortlessly blend in technology,
The LMS will provide a platform not only for learning but some interactive sessions for some educational games and also an easy way of tacking the learners performance.
*This will of course require some knowledge in Database as a module which I'm pursuing cocurrently.
Retrival of student information will also be very simply by just a mouse click everything will be mad available
* 6. What goals are more achievable?
Develop a learning management system which will be user friendly.

## Planning: 
Here try and think about how your project will look like. Ask the following Questions?
* 1. Will the users sign in and log in?
There will be sign in for the learners, teachers and the school adminstrators.
This will include the learners admission numbers, school name, school code, current grade and age for the learners.
The teachers will have their TSC numbers, National ID, school code and porfolio of the teacher whether they are classteachers.
For the school admins, they will be the ones controlling the LMS per school level coordinated by the teachers mandeted to do so.

* 2. Will we have a home page?
the home page will have the user sign and login 
there will be an access control
* 3. Will we have a contact page?
There will be acobtact us page where the users will be able to reach the developres in case of any problem
and a feedback will be provided
* 4. What other features will it have?
we will provide a chart section where users will be able to chart with the developrs
ther teachers will also be able to prepear learning materials and upload them for the learners to download at their own time
** I advice you to draw on a piece of paper a roadmap of what you expect and create a clear plan with dates and timelines.
